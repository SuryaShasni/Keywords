# Keywords
### Hi! I am Surya and this is my record of Keywords.
1. CISC(Complex Instruction Set Computer)- Intel, AMD - Closed source
2. RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer)- ARM - Closed source
3. RISC-V- Open source, based on RISC principles
4. Kernel- An operating system component which forms an interface between computer hardware and processes running on it
    -  Kernel Space: Memory space to run kernel
     - User Space: Memory space to run user processes
      - Kernel programming languages: C, C++, RUST
5. ISA(Instruction Set Architecture)- Defines how CPU is controlled by a software
6. Cloud- Shareable server over the internet
   - Private, Public cloud
   - Eg: AWS(Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, GCP(Google Cloud Platform)
    
7. DNS - turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources.
8. IP Addresss- Internet Protcol (IPv4,IPv6)
9. Public IP - B/W Internet and Device, assigned by internet service provider to the device
10. Private IP - in a private network [starts with 10., 172.16, 192.168]
11. Local IP - [starts with 127.00.0]
12. Port No. - a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.[for http - 80
13. FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Arrays - Configurede after manufacturing
14. Socket - Software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network
15. Protocol- It is a standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data.
16. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data
17.Cryptography - It is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. It is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages.
18. MAC Address - Media Access Control address is a unique identifier assigned for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.(48 bits)
19. TLS - Transport Layer Security encrypts data sent over the Interne
20. STACK - Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. LIFO (Last In First Out)
21. Firmware - It is a microcode or program that is embedded into the memory of hardware devices to help them operate
22. Cache - a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data (temporary mermory)
23. STACK - Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. LIFO (Last In First Out)
24. Bare Metal- Fresh server without an OS/applications.
25. Hypervisor- A software which creates virtual machines
    - Type 1: Directly installed on bare metal
       - Eg: KVM(Kernel-based virtual machine)
    - Type 2: Installed over a host OS
       - Eg: VMware(closed source), Virtual Box(open source)
26. UDP(User Datagram Protocol)- A communications protocol used to send messages to other hosts on an IP network. Within an IP network, UDP doesn't require prior communication to set up communication channels or data paths.
27.Hypervisor - It is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines.
       - TYPE 1 : hypervisor runs directly on the host machine's physical hardware
       - TYPE 2 : hypervisor is typically installed on top of an existing OS.
       - kvm : Kernel-based Virtual Machine is a free and open-source virtualization module in the Linux kernel that allows the kernel to function as a hypervisor.
       - xen : Xen is a free and open-source type-1 hypervisor, providing services that allow multiple computer operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware concurrently.
28. VPN - It establishes a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts your personal data, masks your IP address, and lets you sidestep website blocks and firewalls on the internet.
